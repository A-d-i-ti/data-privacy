üîê Cryptography

Cryptography is the science of securing information through encoding so that only intended recipients can access or understand it.

üîê Symmetric Cryptography

Definition: Uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption.

Use Cases: Fast and efficient, ideal for bulk data encryption.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è AES, TLS, etc.

AES (Advanced Encryption Standard): A widely used symmetric encryption algorithm.

TLS (Transport Layer Security): Uses AES (among others) to encrypt internet communication.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Confidentiality

Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to view it.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è AES in TLS

AES encrypts data during secure web communication via TLS (used in HTTPS).

‚ñ∂Ô∏è End-to-End Messaging

Messages are encrypted on the sender's side and decrypted only by the receiver (e.g., Signal, WhatsApp).

üßæ Asymmetric Cryptography

Definition: Uses a pair of keys: a public key (shared) and a private key (kept secret).

Use Cases: Digital signatures, secure key exchange, identity authentication.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è RSA, ECC, ECDSA

RSA: One of the first public-key encryption systems.

ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography): More efficient than RSA with smaller keys.

ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm): A digital signature scheme used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Digital Signatures

Provide integrity, authenticity, and non-repudiation of data.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è ECDSA (e.g., Bitcoin)

Proves ownership of a Bitcoin wallet by signing a transaction with a private key.

üßæ PKI / x.509 Certificates

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI): A system that binds public keys to identities through digital certificates.

x.509 Certificates: Standard for SSL/TLS certificates (used in HTTPS).

‚ñ∂Ô∏è HTTPS / SSL / TLS

Protocols that secure web traffic. HTTPS uses TLS and certificates to encrypt communication.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Certificate Authorities (CAs)

Trusted organizations that issue and manage digital certificates. Central point of trust.

üë• Threshold Signatures

A type of multi-party cryptography where multiple private key holders jointly sign a message.

Use Case: Used in cryptocurrency custody wallets where multiple approvals are needed to move funds.

üÜî Verifiable Credentials and DIDs

Verifiable Credentials (VCs): Digitally signed claims about a person or entity.

DIDs (Decentralized Identifiers): A standard for self-owned, decentralized digital identities.

üîí Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI)

A model where individuals own and control their identity and credentials without relying on a central authority.

Identity Mixer: A cryptographic tool allowing selective disclosure (only reveal necessary info).

üß∞ Privacy Enhancing Technologies (PETs)

A broad set of tools and protocols designed to enhance privacy and limit data exposure.

üïµÔ∏è Anonymity Techniques

These methods aim to hide identities or transaction metadata.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Ring Signatures (Monero)

Allows someone in a group to sign a message without revealing which member signed it.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è zk-SNARKs (Zcash)

Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge: Proves you know a secret (like an amount or key) without revealing it.

Used in Zcash for private transactions.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Blind Signatures

A signer signs a message without knowing its contents.

Used in anonymous e-cash systems.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Mixers and Tumblers

Pool and shuffle cryptocurrency transactions to break the on-chain link between sender and recipient.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è CoinJoin and CoinShuffle

CoinJoin: Users combine their transactions into one to make it hard to link inputs to outputs.

CoinShuffle: An improved, more decentralized version of CoinJoin.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Stealth Addresses

One-time addresses generated for each transaction to protect recipient identity (used in Monero).

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Dandelion Protocol

Obscures the origin of cryptocurrency transactions by relaying them over random paths before broadcasting.

‚ñ∂Ô∏è Pseudonymity

Using consistent but fake identifiers (like Bitcoin addresses) that don‚Äôt reveal your real identity but can still be tracked over time.

## **ANONYMITY :**

| Technique           | Description                                                                          |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Interactive**     | Requires real-time communication (e.g., mixers, MPC, CoinJoin).                      |
| **Non-Interactive** | One-shot or stand-alone cryptographic techniques (e.g., zk-SNARKs, Ring Signatures). |

## Another way to achieve annonymity is to check at different levels :
